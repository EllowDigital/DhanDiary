// CLOUD FUNCTIONS ARCHIVE
// This file previously contained Cloud Functions to maintain server-side summaries.
// The project is now configured to remain on Firebase Spark (free) and use SQLite as
// the primary source of truth with a local sync engine. Keep this file as an
// archival reference only — do NOT deploy Cloud Functions for this project.

// Keep this file as an archival reference only; no functions are exported.
// The project intentionally remains on Firebase Spark and uses SQLite as
// the primary datastore. Any previous Cloud Functions code was removed.
